Week 1 Assignment

With 11 encrypted messages, all using the same key, had to build a program to discover the 11th message. Started search for 'the' as it is the most commun word in a english text.
Used the crib dragging as described in here: http://travisdazell.blogspot.in/2012/11/many-time-pad-attack-crib-drag.html

w2-assignment.py
Week 2 Assignment

Given the key and ciphertexts I had to decrypt 4 text using 2 AES in CBC mode and another 2 using AES in counter mode (CTR). Build a python program to decrypt these messages.

w2-p9.py
Week 2 - Question 9

On this problem, was given the code to create the cipher, the 3 cipher texts, and 4 messages in binary format.
Have to discover without knowing the keys, what was the ciphertext for the 4 message.
